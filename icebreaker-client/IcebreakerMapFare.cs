    // the map-screen crossing fare, shaped exactly like the LABS access flow:
    //   1. the READY button refuses unless the fare is in the gear you're taking
    //      (method_54 is the same gate that refuses without a labs keycard, and it
    //      checks EPlayerItems.Equipment — carried gear, not stash)
    //   2. the fare is CONSUMED at raid creation, before anything loads
    //      (labs does this in BaseLocalGame pre-spawn via a local grid removal; ours
    //      runs in LocalGame.smethod_6, the factory that receives the Profile, which
    //      is the same point of no return one call earlier)
    // the removal is deliberately LOCAL, no network transaction — identical to the
    // labs keycard, whose removal persists through the raid-end inventory sync.
    //
    // the price is a CONST on purpose (user call 08-19, the transit teardown): it used
    // to read the TransitCost config, which let anyone zero the fare from their
    // bepinex config. the map screen is now the only way aboard and the fare is part
    // of the map's economy, so it ships hardcoded like the labs keycard requirement.
    //
    // the BTR questline's payoff (user call, same day): finishing Hangover, the end of
    // the Saving Private Roman chain, HALVES the fare. that replaced the chain's old
    // reward of unlocking the map screen, which Boreas P3 now grants much earlier.
