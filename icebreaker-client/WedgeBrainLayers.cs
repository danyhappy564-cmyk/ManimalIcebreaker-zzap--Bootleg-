    // WEDGE BOSS AI, round 1 (user call 08-13, from docs/BOSSWEDGE-AI-REPORT.md — the
    // retail 1.0 wedge brain decompile). retail wedge is a patient cover-fighting
    // ambush boss; this file ports the two lowest-risk, highest-flavor pieces:
    //
    //   1. CLOSE-RANGE TAUNTS — retail WedgeCloseDist fires EPhraseTrigger.Provocation
    //      on a periodic while fighting inside its close band. verified present in the
    //      4.0 assembly and wired through BotTalk.TrySay, which self-gates on CanSay.
    //   2. ONE PUSHER AT A TIME — retail followers ask the boss before pushing
    //      (ShallHoldBecauseRecentGroupGoToEnemy): while one squadmate advances on a
    //      known-but-unseen enemy, the rest hold cover. ported as a push token: the
    //      sanctioned pusher runs vanilla combat, everyone else holds until the token
    //      rotates. our machinery, retail's behavior.
    //
    // the standing rule from the terminal ports applies double to a boss squad: NEVER
    // replace visible-enemy gunfighting. the hold yields the instant a bot's enemy is
    // visible or it comes under fire, and with no known enemy at all it stands down
    // entirely (vanilla patrol / crew guard keeps the bot). round 1 deliberately does
    // NOT touch the boss's own combat — no bands, no blood-ambush yet.
    //
    // NO MUTE anywhere in this file (user call: wedge is not the engine-room hold
    // squad and must keep his voice — the taunts are the whole point).
